            <h3>Tower Lake Vacations</h3>
          
            <p>Looking for a holiday home to rent in Florida? We currently have a fantastic 5 bedroom, 4 bathroom executive villa for rent in Orlando. The villa is situated on the prestigious lakeside gated community at Tower Lake, near Davenport.</p>

            <p>Inside the villa there is a large open plan living area which has been tastefully furnished. In addition to the 5 bedrooms there is a Den (alternative 6th bedroom if required), a games room with pool table, air-hockey and foosball (table-football), two dining areas and a 'loft' area. There is also free wi-fi access throughout the villa and cable TV.

            <p>The villa comes with complementary facilities provided for babies and young children, with a bottle steriliser and high chair for use. For larger parties we are in contact with other villa owners on the community should you require more than one villa. Our management company who are based close to the villa also remain on call 24 hours a day should you need them and are very helpful. They offer additional services such as cot hire, BBQ, stroller or other items if needed. Feel free to contact them if you require any of these items.</p>

            <p>If you are a golfer, the Southern Dunes golf course (rated one of the top 100 courses in the U.S.) is situated adjacent to the complex. Greg Norman designed Champions Gate is also close to the complex, amongst others. In the immediate vicinity there are a good selection of restaurants and a large 24 hour Wal-Mart with everything you could possibly need for your stay. The newly completed retail center 'Posner Park' is also 6 miles away.</p>

            <p>You can fish in Tower Lake which boasts a boat ramp &amp; fishing jetty. It's a popular location for catching bass. There is also the lake side Club House which is nearing completion and offers with lake views and balconies.</p>

            <p>For more information regarding this villa, please visit our website <a href="http://www.towerlakevacations.com" target="_blank">here</a></p>
