            <h2>The Service</h2>

              <div class="content-background">
                <p>Once you purchase a sat nav we will ensure the device turns up in plenty of time for your trip without any hassle, aleviating the risk of the car hire company not having a device to hire you once you pick up your car - all at a lower cost too!</p>

                <p>This service takes away the stress when arriving in Florida or anywhere else in the USA, Canada or Europe. After your flight pick up your car, turn the sat nav on and let your trip begin!!</p>

                <p>We can pre-load any destination prior to your trip if you so desire, just let us have the details.  All sat navs currently provided are TomTom's and are fully checked, charged and cleaned between rentals.  We will be providing Garmin in the near future.</p>

                <p>This service will save you from costly car hire rental charges - we paid $99 for 12 days sat nav hire last year!</p>

                <h3>What if it doesn't work when I arrive or stops working during my trip?</h3>

                <p>We are confident this will not happen since all sat nav's are checked before being despatched, however if this does then please either drop us a text, E-Mail or call (number coming shortly) and we will give you approval to buy a new device nearest to your location and we will refund you the cost of the new sat nav.  (Please note that both the broken sat nav and new one will need to be returned to us at the end of your hire period along with the receipt to obtain your refund).</p>
